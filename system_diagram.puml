' Relationships and data flow
crawlerProcess --> crawlTopic : Subscribes to
spider --> webPages : Crawls
spider --> gcs : Stores HTML content
spider --> indexTopic : Publishes indexing tasks
heartbeat --> heartbeatTopic : Sends heartbeats
spider --> completeTopic : Reports completion
urlManager --> crawlTopic : Publishes new URLs

' Notes

  - Extracts links
  - Stores content
  - Manages depth
end note

note right of gcs

  content with URL-based
  naming
end note

note right of heartbeatTopic
